# EMAVWAP-X (Private Beta)

**What it is:** A simple, disciplined signal concept: act when **EMA** crosses **VWAP** on your chosen session.  
**Status:** Private beta (invite-only on TradingView).  
**Platform:** TradingView (invite-only script). **Later:** NinjaTrader port (planned).

**Price / early testers:**  
A handful of test users from the waitlist will be invited to try the working solution and give feedback on value, usability, clarity and price.  
As thanks, test users will receive a **~70-90% discount** on the final subscription price.

**How to join the waitlist (private):**  
Email **sohail@creditive.com** with subject **“EMAVWAP-X Waitlist”** and include:  
- Your **TradingView username** (required)  
- Your **email** (used only for updates and support. It will never be shared with third parties, and you won’t receive spam. I believe spam-marketing should be illegal)

**Notes**  
- Updates, release notes, and access logistics will be posted here.  
- Invite-only access will be granted later on TradingView (and potentially NinjaTrader).
