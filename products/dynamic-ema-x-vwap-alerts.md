# Dynamic EMA x VWAP Alerts (Private Beta)

**What it is:** A simple, disciplined signal concept: act when **EMA** crosses **VWAP** on your chosen session.  
**Status:** Private beta (invite-only on TradingView).  
**Platform:** TradingView (invite-only script). **Later:** NinjaTrader port (planned).

**How to join the waitlist (private):**  
Email **quantastic.analysis@gmail.com** with subject **â€œDynamic EMA x VWAP Alerts Waitlistâ€** and include:
