# EMA VWAP Crossover Buy Signals

A **TradingView Pine Script** indicator designed for **low-risk, high-reward scalping setups**.  
Best used on **3-minute candlesticks**, this tool combines **Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)** with **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)** and multiple support band levels to pinpoint high-probability **buy entries** during intraday trading.

⚠️ Important: Not recommended for use during low-volume periods or algo-dominated trading sessions, as signals may be unreliable in thin markets.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. **EMA Crossover** — Fast EMA crosses above Slow EMA = potential bullish reversal.
2. **Support Zone Check** — Price must be at or below VWAP, near defined support bands.
3. **Signal Classification**:
   - **Band 1–2** = mild oversold, early signal
   - **Band 2–3** = deeper oversold, stronger signal
   - **Below Band 3** = extreme oversold, highest conviction
4. **Stop-Loss Marking**:
   - If price drops by a set amount after signal, label as “WRONG” for trade review.

## Use Cases
- **Intraday scalping** in volatile markets.
- **Dip buying** during strong trends.
- Filtering entries using both **trend (EMA)** and **mean reversion (VWAP)** signals.

## Note on Code Origin:
The Pine Script codes were initially mostly generated with the help of large language models (LLMs) to speed up the development process. However, all trading algorithms, logic, and parameter settings are my own original work. Each indicator has been thoroughly tested and deployed on TradingView, where it’s actively used and has been tested and boosted by over 50 traders within the first days of release.
