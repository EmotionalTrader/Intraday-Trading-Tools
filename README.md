# Intraday-Trading-Tools

A curated suite of very basic intraday trading tools for TradingView. Includes EMA-VWAP crossover signals, Rolling VWAP suites, and Daily/Weekly VWAPs.

## Note on Code Origin
The Pine Script codes were initially mostly generated with the help of large language models (LLMs) to speed up the development process. However, all trading algorithms, logic, and parameter settings are my own original work. Each indicator has been thoroughly tested and deployed on TradingView, where it‚Äôs actively used and has been tested and boosted by over 50 traders within the first days of release.

## Additional Information

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This software and its indicators are provided for educational and informational purposes only and do not constitute financial advice. Trading involves significant risk, and many individuals lose money, particularly when trading futures. Use these tools at your own risk, and consult a qualified financial advisor before making any trading decisions.

### Instrument Suitability
These indicators are primarily built for SP500 Futures (ES and MES) but can be suitable for other instruments as well, depending on your trading strategy and testing.

### Trading Recommendations
Trading based solely on indicators is not recommended. Many people lose money trading, especially in futures, due to the high volatility and leverage involved. For better decision-making:
- Use **support and resistance levels** as your primary decision basis.
- Consider **price action and pattern breakouts** as secondary decision basis.
- Use indicators (like those provided here) as a tertiary decision basis.
- Before entering a position, check **RSI (Relative Strength Index) levels** to gauge overbought or oversold conditions.

### Community and Support
If you have any questions, feel free to DM me on TradingView or GitHub. If you find these indicators useful, please star this repository on GitHub or boost them on my [TradingView account](https://www.tradingview.com/u/EmotionalTrader777/) Your support helps me continue developing these tools!

### Future Updates
These versions are very simple and basic, and they are free to use. I am currently working on deploying more advanced algorithms in the near future, so keep an eye out here on my GitHub or my [TradingView account](https://www.tradingview.com/u/EmotionalTrader777/) for updates.
