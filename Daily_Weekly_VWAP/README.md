# VWAP Combo: Weekly + Fibonacci Bands & Daily + Standard Deviation Bands

A **TradingView Pine Script** that combines **two VWAP-based analysis methods** into one flexible indicator:

1. **V1** — Weekly VWAP with Fibonacci-based standard deviation bands.
2. **V2** — Daily VWAP with standard deviation bands.

This suite is built for traders who want to track both macro (weekly) and micro (daily) price positioning against dynamic VWAP anchors.

## 🛠 How It Works

### **V1 – Weekly VWAP + Fibonacci Bands**
- VWAP resets at the start of each week.
- Standard deviation of price around VWAP is calculated.
- Fibonacci multipliers (`fib1`, `fib2`) define the upper/lower band distances.
- Useful for **macro trend anchoring** and spotting stretched price conditions.

### **V2 – Daily VWAP + Standard Deviation Bands**
- VWAP resets at the start of each day.
- Two sets of ±standard deviation bands define near-term price extremes.
- Optional previous-day VWAP plotting for intraday bias reference.

## ⚡ Use Cases

- **Support & Resistance**:  
  VWAP bands act as dynamic S/R levels.
- **Trend Context**:  
  Price location relative to weekly/daily VWAP helps define bias.
- **Volatility Analysis**:  
  Standard deviation bands adapt to volatility conditions.
- **Trade Timing**:  
  Use confluence between daily and weekly VWAP bands to find high-probability setups.

Note on Code Origin:
The Pine Script codes were initially mostly generated with the help of large language models (LLMs) to speed up the development process. However, all trading algorithms, logic, and parameter settings are my own original work. Each indicator has been thoroughly tested and deployed on TradingView, where it’s actively used and has been tested and boosted by over 50 traders within the first days of release.
